CATALOG_README = """# Standards

Code standards for this organisation, in Markdown, written to be read by people and consumed
mechanically by the GATE review skills.

Built with [GATE](https://github.com/javierdres/gate-framework).

## It starts empty on purpose

There are no rules yet, and that is not a pending task: it is the design.

A rule set written in one sitting, before there are real cases, does not describe the
organisation. It describes whoever copied it. Here **every rule has to show which discussion or
incident it came from** — the `origin` field is required and validated.

The catalog fills up through use, from the discussions in reviews and the root causes of
incidents. Until it does, review is not left without a bar: it leans on the industry baseline,
OWASP, SOLID and Clean Code, and on each project's own conventions. This repository sits on top
of that baseline, it does not replace it.

## Two severities

| Level | Directory | What belongs there | How review reports it |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Hard rule** | `rules/hard/` | Non-negotiable security: hardcoded secrets, injection, access control, insecure configuration | **Blocking** |
| **Soft rule** | `rules/soft/` | SOLID, clean code, readability | **Suggestion** |

A rule in `candidate` status never blocks, whatever its severity.

## This repository is the organisation

Within GATE, two projects reading this catalog are, by construction, the same organisation.
Nothing else defines that relationship.

## How a rule gets in

It is harvested, not written. `/harvest` runs on every pass of `/review` and on the closing of
every incident, and proposes candidates traceable to a real decision. Promoting a candidate to
`in force` is a human decision. See [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md).

## Checks

```
python3 bin/validate.py          # rule format, ids, sections
python3 bin/generate_catalog.py  # rebuild catalog.json
```

`catalog.json` is generated. Do not edit it by hand.
"""

CATALOG_GOVERNANCE = """# Governance

## A rule's life

```
candidate ──► in force ──► deprecated
    │
    └──► (rejected: the merge request is closed, no file is left)
```

| Status | What it means | Effect on review |
|---|---|---|
| `candidate` | Formulated from a real decision, not yet approved | Reported as a **suggestion**, whatever its severity. Never blocks. |
| `in force` | Approved | Hard → **blocking**. Soft → suggestion. |
| `deprecated` | Superseded or dropped | Ignored. The file is **not** deleted. |

**Deprecated rule files are not deleted.** An old review may cite `HR-0007`; if the id
disappears that comment is orphaned. Mark `status: deprecated` and `superseded_by: <id>`, and
never reuse an id.

## Who approves

Promoting a candidate to `in force` requires approval on the merge request.

For **soft** rules, one reviewer who did not write it.

For **hard** rules, the group this organisation names as custodians. Define it before the first
hard rule, not during the argument about it. With more than one project this stops being a
single person.

## What does not go in this repository

**How a particular project is built.** Its patterns, its stack, its deliberate exceptions.
That belongs in that project's own documentation, and GATE points at it through
`project.definition` in the project's `.gate/config.yml`.

**Generic good practice with no decision of our own behind it.** The industry baseline already
covers it, and adding it here drowns out the signal.

## False positives

`calibration/false-positives.md` does not follow the life cycle above: it is not approved, not
versioned, and the validator does not look at it. An entry there blocks nothing — it only tells
review that a finding was already discussed and dismissed.

That is deliberate. If recording a false positive cost a merge request with approval, nobody
would record one, and calibration would go back to living only in conversation.

What does go through this governance: if the false positive comes from a **badly written rule**,
the rule gets fixed, by merge request, like any other change.
"""

CATALOG_CONTRIBUTING = """# Contributing a rule

Rules are harvested by `/harvest`, not written from scratch. This document is the format they
have to meet.

## File naming

```
rules/hard/HR-0001-no-concatenated-input-in-sql.md
rules/soft/SR-0001-extract-a-method-instead-of-a-flag.md
```

- `HR-` for a hard rule, in `rules/hard/`. `SR-` for a soft one, in `rules/soft/`.
- Four digits, sequential and **independent** per prefix. The next free id comes from
  `catalog.json`.
- Slug in lowercase with hyphens. An id is **never** reused, not even once deprecated.

## Frontmatter

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `HR-NNNN` / `SR-NNNN` | yes | Must match the filename and the directory |
| `title` | text | yes | Names the rule, does not justify it |
| `severity` | `hard` / `soft` | yes | Consistent with the id prefix |
| `status` | `candidate` / `in force` / `deprecated` | yes | See GOVERNANCE.md |
| `scope` | list | yes | `cross-cutting`, or a stack: `php`, `sql`, `js`, `shell`, `iac`, `ci` |
| `projects` | list | yes | `cross-cutting`, or specific project ids |
| `tags` | list | yes, may be empty | Free: `owasp-a03`, `injection`, `secrets` |
| `origin` | list of URLs | yes, not empty | The discussion, note or postmortem it came from |
| `approved_by` | list | yes, empty if candidate | Not empty if `status: in force` |
| `created` | `YYYY-MM-DD` | yes | |
| `updated` | `YYYY-MM-DD` | yes | |
| `supersedes` | list of ids | yes, may be empty | |
| `superseded_by` | id or `null` | yes | Required if `status: deprecated` |

## Required sections

`## Do not`, `## Do instead`, `## Why`, `## How it is checked`.

`## Exceptions`, `## Evidence` and `## History` are optional, except that a hard rule with no
exceptions must say so explicitly.

## Before opening a merge request

```
python3 bin/generate_catalog.py && python3 bin/validate.py
```

Both have to come back clean.
"""

CATALOG_FALSE_POSITIVES = """# Known false positives

Findings that review raises and the team has already rejected, with the reason. The review
skills read this file first so they do not raise them again. Context in
[GOVERNANCE.md](../GOVERNANCE.md).

Entry format:

```markdown
## FP-NNNN — Short title

- **What review raises:** the claim the assistant makes.
- **Why it does not apply:** the reason, in one sentence that will still serve next time.
- **How to avoid it:** what to check before raising it.
- **Origin:** a link to the discussion or the rejected finding.
- **Recorded:** YYYY-MM-DD

Sequential numbering, never reused. No validator and no approval: it is added in the same merge
request where the rejection happened.

# HR-0000 — A short phrase naming the rule

## Do not

What is forbidden, concretely. Nameable in code: a function, a pattern, a way of writing
something. If you cannot point at it in a diff, it is not a rule yet.

## Do instead

The concrete alternative that replaces it. With code if it helps.

## Why

What breaks if it is not followed. Real impact, not "it is bad practice".

## How it is checked

The heuristic a person or an agent uses to check this rule against a change. Concrete and
runnable:

```bash
grep -rn "forbidden_pattern" --include="*.ext" .
```

If the check has known false positives, say so here.

## Exceptions

(Optional) Cases where the rule does not apply, and why. If a hard rule has none, write
"None. This is a hard rule."

## Evidence

(Optional) Links to real code, incidents or findings behind the rule.

## History

(Optional) One line per change of status or of demand.
